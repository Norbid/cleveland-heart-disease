# Cleveland Heart Disease – Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling in R

This repository contains a complete data analysis project based on the **Cleveland Heart Disease** dataset.  
The goal is to clean the data, explore key clinical characteristics, and build a logistic regression model to predict the presence of heart disease.

The project is implemented entirely in **R**, following a modular, reproducible structure suitable for a professional GitHub portfolio.
